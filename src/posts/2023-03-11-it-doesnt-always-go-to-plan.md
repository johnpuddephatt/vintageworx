B﻿rrr...its a bit chilly on Falinge Park this week. The snow has stopped play temporarily! We were due to host our international women's day event today but unfortunately the weather has had other ideas!

N﻿o problem we will postpone and celebrate the greatness of women another day! Meanwhile coming up this month ...weather allowing...we have green volunteer sessions every Sunday 10.30 - 12.30, The Great British Spring Clean on 28th March 10.30 -12 and we will be supporting some students from Hopwood Hall to gain some work experience every Friday. Mencap are making some great progress on their accessible planters and our fabulous bus project is coming along in leaps and bounds....spring is indeed in the air!

I﻿f you want to join in on all our park endeavours feel free to get in touch!
