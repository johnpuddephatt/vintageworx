The new Hot Chocolate Hub that runs every Friday from 10am – 12pm to support ladies who are going through or need information on the Menopause or Perimenopause.

Suzan says “Recent meetings with both Cllr Rachel Massey and Joanne Faulkner from Home Instead Rochdale showed there was very little support for this boroughwide and no support in Spotland and Falinge at all, further talks with resident groups confirmed this and I knew I had to set up a support group.

I’ve worked closely with Vintage Worx for quite a while now and I thought the park was a superb location to set this up.

I approached Tracie who offered the room for free and suggested we provide a hot drink and biscuits to everyone who comes. The hot drink became Hot Chocolate and hey presto the Hot Chocolate Hub was born. I mean let’s face it, what better is there for ladies to support each other than over a steaming mug of Hot Chocolate and some tasty biscuits.”
