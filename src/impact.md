  title: A community approach to neighbourhood issues
  description: |
    With some of the most severe levels of multiple deprivation in the country and no mainstream provision, the neighbourhood needed a fresh approach.

    VintageWorx combines local knowledge with community experience to help tackle social issues.

  title: 10 years and counting
  description: |
    Community involvement has grown VintageWorx from a small community group to a large community-led organisation, showing local residents what can be achieved by working together.

    Through VintageWorx, local people have someone on their side, someone that empowers them to start making change. By working together with local people weâ€™re tackling social isolation, giving people the skills and training they need, running events that bring the community together and working to restore the local park to create a community-owned and managed asset of which local people can be proud.
