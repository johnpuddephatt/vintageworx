  As part of our ongoing support of local community business and social enterprise Vintage Worx will be hosting an open day in the Tea rooms for the Community Business Weekend to showcase our work and the work of local community businesses in the area
---
As part of the event we will be hosting our FIRST EVER Falinge Park Community Soup!!

Community Soup is a crowd funding initiative that lets the community pick what they want to fund.

Four or Five local community groups are invited to present their projects to the community and whilst the community enjoys a hot fresh meal, they can vote on who should win the cash prize.

Each member of the community pays an entry fee which creates the funds for the event - so the community is supporting the groups who win themselves!

Eveyone is welcome!

If you would like to put your community group forward for support please contact us now!!

Entry Price for the Soup is Â£4
