Our fantastic International Culture event returns for the fourth year. This year it promises to have even more cultures represented in food, fashion, craft and entertainment.

We want to help showcase handmade items and products from around the area. Anything handmade, handgrown, home produced is welcome. Get in touch if you would like to be involved.
