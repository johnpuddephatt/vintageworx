  welcome to
  our park
intro:
  title: |
    We’re working to transform our park,
    local area and the lives of local people.
  part_one: |
    For over ten years we’ve been removing barriers and increasing potential.

    We provide workshops, training and support that give local people the belief and power to take control of their lives and achieve their goals.
  part_two: |
    **Our approach is different.** We develop genuine relationships with people that give them the confidence and self-belief they need to bring about positive change in their lives.

    We’re transforming our park to further our work and provide a community-owned and led space that local people can be proud of.
