        <p>Timber pods along one side of the walkway will provide space for community uses including training, wellbeing and activities, while community landscaped planters will line the opposite side.</p>
        <p>A new cafe and tearooms will provide the space we need for people to socialise together and will also act as a bookable function space.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">Creating a Victorian village green</h3>
        <p>We plan to create a Victorian ‘village green’ on the area of land adjacent to the main road. By landscaping the area and installing wooden structures in the style of Victorian bandstands, we’ll provide a space where new local social enterprises can operate.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">Restoring the current buildings</h3>
        <p>We plan to restore the current buildings to improve theirinteriors, making them more efficient to heat and more secure.This work will restore the footprint of the current facade, creating space for community rooms, function space and a heritageinformation centre.</p>
        <p>We’ll also restore the courtyard fountain, toilets, and otheroriginal features.</p>
