title: Green Volunteers Project
subtitle: Funded through GMCVO & Greater Manchester Integrated Care Partnership
intro: >
  As a result of the wellbeing grant we received last year we have continued to
  grow our green volunteers group on the park. We have regular weekly Litterpick
  sessions and have some participants take over small beds on the park to
  maintain. This year we want to create a gardening clubhouse and potting shed
  for our green volunteers where they can learn practical skills around growing
  and biodiversity. We want to have the volunteers work together to design and
  begin to plant up a large scale herbaceous border planting area in the park.
  This area will form the focus for community planting in the area and become a
  learning point for new volunteers and participants to the project.

## What is the project?

We plan to host 30 sessions focusing specifically on this project.

We will begin each session with refreshments and a chance for participants to share thoughts on how they want the session to run for the day. 

Each session will involve a practical element, a learning element and a social element.

We want our members to have the opportunity to build social relationships as well as practical skills and knowledge.


## 5 points to Wellbeing

***Be Active:*** The project will involve regular weekly sessions outdoors, working to regenerate a historic park area and improve the local environment. This will involve practical gardening including maintenance and planting activities.

***Notice:*** We will be encouraging members to be aware of how nature and the environment can have an affect on their wellbeing and recognise how beneficial engaging with people and the outside world can be. We will encourage mindful activities and ensure that members take the time to enjoy the activities.

***Connect:*** The project aims to bring people together with a mutual interest in gardening, biodiversity and restoration of gardens. We want to build new friend groups and allow socially isolated and de-motivated people to connect with each other through the shared goal of improving their local environment.


***Give:*** The purpose of the project is for the participants to volunteer their time to help improve the greenspace within the park and create a safe space for older and vulnerable members of the community to meet and share environmental activities. 


***Learn:*** We will encourage our members to learn new skills in horticulture, biodiversity and planting. We will teach them about designing a herbaceous border that will flourish throughout the year and there will be opportunities for members to learn or rediscover skills in woodwork and DIY through the transformation of the clubhouse.
