    Our plans for Falinge Park are being designed by the local community for the
    local community to bring benefits far beyond the park walls.


    Securing ownership of the park is empowering local residents to believe in
    the park’s potential and our blueprint is being shaped by consultations,
    suggestion boards, information days and user group ideas.

intro:
  description: >
    The project aims to restore current buildings within the park for the
    benefit of the community and develop new features which will breathe new
    life into this wonderful green space.


    When developed the park will host a myriad of activities and services run
    both by and for the local community whilst protecting the site’s heritage
    value.
