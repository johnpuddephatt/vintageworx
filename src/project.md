    Our plans for Falinge Park are being designed by the local community for the local community to bring benefits far beyond the park walls.

    Securing ownership of the park is empowering local residents to believe in the park’s potential and our blueprint is being shaped by consultations, suggestion boards, information days and user group ideas.

  title: Restoring our Victorian park
  description: |
    The project is aiming to restore current buildings within the park for the benefit of the community and develop new features which will breathe new life into this wonderful green space.

    When developed the park will host a myriad of activities and services run both by and for the local community whilst protecting the site’s heritage value.
