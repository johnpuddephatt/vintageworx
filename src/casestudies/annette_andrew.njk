quote: |
  I got involved doing car boot sales and ended up helping set up the craft group.

  It’s been going for two years now and it’s a great way to help people and make new friends. Andrew was asked if he wanted to get more involved and become a director which has been really good for him.

  It would be great if the park could be used to its full potential and go back to how it was when I was little.
