  We’ve lived in Rochdale for three years and it’s really helped us meet new people

  We found out about Vintage Worx by coming to the park with our children to play. We worked with them to put on a jamboree which celebrated traditions from a variety of African countries.

  A lot of people came and it was a great way to bring the community together.
