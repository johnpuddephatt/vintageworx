  The park is going to be brilliant… It’s going to bring so many more people here.

  I starting volunteering here when I was out of work and it really helped build my confidence up. When you come in here, even if you don’t know anyone, it feels like you’ve known them for ages anyway because everyone is so easy to talk to and friendly. It feel like it’s a bit of a family and it’s nice to be part of that.
