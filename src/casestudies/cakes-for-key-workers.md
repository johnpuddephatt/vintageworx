title: Cakes For Key Workers
quote: >
  This morning a lovely card & Cakes were on my desk. It is so heartwarming for
  me and my team to receive tokens of appreciation and thanks in these difficult
  times...The cakes will be thoroughly enjoyed!


  Throughout the covid lockdown period, Vintage Volunteers spent their time baking! Our fabulous cakes were delivered to key workers across the borough to show them how much they are appreciated! Police, Nurses, Firefighters, Post men/women, Refuse collectors, prison officers: you name them we fed them!
